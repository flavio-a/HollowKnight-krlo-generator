# HollowKnight-krlo-generator

To run locally, install npm dev-dependencies and then:
```bash
npm run start
```

This starts the development server, listening on port 8080.

## Deploy
I use [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages). To deploy just run
```bash
npm run deploy
```

This creates the branch directly on GitHub.

## TODO
- make the split maker
- make a favicon
